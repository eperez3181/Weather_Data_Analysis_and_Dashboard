## Background

HTML and CSS was used to create a website that showcases a dashboard featuring a previous analysis conducted. The analysis consisted of observations that were plotted showing the relationship latitude has on different weather factors suchs as: temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed.

Bootstrap and @media was used in order to make the website functional and responsive
